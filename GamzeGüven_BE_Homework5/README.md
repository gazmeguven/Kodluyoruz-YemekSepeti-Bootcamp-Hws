## Dapper

* Dapper is a simple object mapper for .NET and as fast as using a raw ADO.NET data reader. Dapper is an ADO.NET based "Micro" ORM library. An ORM is an Object Relational Mapper, which is responsible for mapping between database and programming language.

* Dapper extends the IDbConnection by providing useful extension methods to query your database.

* There are basic three steps for Dapper's working
  1. Create an IDbConnection object.
  2. Write a query to perform CRUD operations.
  3. Pass query as a parameter in the Execute method.


1. Select In Query
2. Insert
3. Update
4. Delete
5. Delete In Query
6. Transactional Insert
7. Result Mapping
8. One-to-One Mapping
9. Multiple Query Mapping
